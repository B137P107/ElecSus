Description: ==============
        ElecSus v2.1.0
        ==============
        
        A program to calculate the electric susceptibility of an atomic ensemble.
        The program is designed to model weak probe laser spectra on the D-lines
        of thermal alkali metal vapour cells. The program also includes fitting 
        routines which allow experimental parameters to be extracted from 
        experimental spectroscopic data.
        
        --------------------
        New in version 2.0
        --------------------
        
        	-	Significantly improved user-friendliness in the form of a 
        		GUI to aid in calculating theory spectra and fitting 
        		experimental data. 
        		
        		Works on Windows and Linux, tested on Windows 7, 8.1, 10
        		and Ubuntu 14.04. Currently not tested on Mac.
        
        	-	Rewritten fitting routines MLFittingRouine.py,
        		RRFittingRoutine.py and SAFittingRoutine.py to support
        		keyword arguments, passed to scipy.curve_fit / leastsq
        		methods
        
        	-	Added new support modules:
        		- elecsus_methods.py
        		- libs/data_proc.py
        		
        		elecsus_new.py contains two simplified methods for either
        		calculating spectra or fitting data, and should be easier to 
        		interface with external code for, e.g., batch processing / 
        		fitting of data or generating 2D plots.
        
        		data_proc.py contains methods for binning (reducing the 
        		number of data points by local averaging) and moving-average 
        		smoothing data traces
        
        		both of these new modules are used by the GUI program
        		
        	-	Renamed the old elecsus.py module for added clarity
        	
        		elecsus.py --> elecsus_runcard.py
        		
        		This is the old method of calling elecsus with <runcard>.py files as system arguments.
        		This way is now obsolete, being replaced by either the GUI or the methods contained in
        		elecsus_methods.py. For backwards compatibility, the elecsus_runcard.py module allows
        		the runcards to be used in the same way as before.
        		
        		The example runcards and example data have been moved to sub-directories, 
        		/runcard and /sample_data, respectively.
        		
        	-	Added a new module, spectra_Efield.py
        		
        		This module allows calcualtion of spectra with the output of electric field vectors, rather
        		than spectroscopic quantities. This should allow calculation of spectra in cells with non-uniform
        		magnetic fields, by splitting the cell into sufficiently small parts that the field variation
        		across any one part is negligible. Spectroscopic quantities can be calculated from the electric
        		field vector by using Jones matrices.
        		
        
        -------------
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        Must have the python programming language installed with the following 
        packages:
        
        	- Scipy version 0.12.0 or later
        	- Numpy
        	- Matplotlib
        	- wxPython 2.8 (for GUI)
        
        
        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Python and required packages must be installed prior to installing ElecSus.
        
        	- Download the zip file and extract the ElecSus directory.
        
        	- For windows, there are pre-built binaries which will install ElecSus for you. Simply double click on the installer exe/msi file and follow the instructions.
        	
        	- For linux-based systems, download or clone this repository and navigate to the download location in a terminal window. Install using the setup.py file by typing
        		
        		python setup.py install
        	
        	- Note the GUI part of ElecSus is currently untested on Mac OSX!
        
        -----
        Usage
        -----
        
        	1. For GUI operation:
        
        	- After package installation, from the python interpreter type:
        	
        		from elecsus import elecsus_gui
        		
        		elecsus_gui.start()
        
        	- In windows, double-click on the run_gui.bat file in the elecsus directory
        
        	- Alternately, open a terminal or command-line window and navigate to the ElecSus directory. Type:
        
        		python elecsus_gui.py
        			
        	2. For Runcard operation:
        
        	- Open a terminal window and move to the directory where the files have been extracted to.
        
        	- To run the program taking parameters from runcard.py type:
        
        		python elecsus_runcard.py
        
        	- To run using parameters from a particular runcard type
        
        		python elecsus_runcard.py <run card file name>
        
        	- So to run a the first D1 example, type
        
        		python elecsus.py runcard_D1sample.py
        
        	- To run the second example, type
        
        		python elecsus.py runcard_D2sample.py
        		
        
        	3. For integration into external code:
        	
        	- The elecsus_methods.py module contains two methods, calculate() and fit_data(), 
        	  which allow for easy integration into external codes. See the elecsus_methods.py source
        	  for more details

        Change Log
        -----------
        
        V 2.1.0
        
        	- Cleaned up a lot of code in the spectra.py module. Added new methods (calc_chi, get_spectra) to spectra.py that allow users to easily create wrapper methods to return custom data types that aren't returned by default. Separated the method to calculate electric field propagation (get_Efield), for use with non-uniform B fields. Backward compatibility is preserved with the spectrum() method, which is now just a wrapper for get_spectra().
        	
        V 2.0.3
        
        	- Bug fix for the runcard method of using ElecSus. Now supports runcards in directories other than the local directory.
        	
        V 2.0.2
        
        	- Minor bug fix for the GUI - fixed an issue where the Phi plots would not be plotted
        	
        V 2.0.1
        
        	- Updated Eigensystem.py with correct fine structure constant for Rb.
